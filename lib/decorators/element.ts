/**
 * Generates a decorator function to convert a class into a custom element
 * through the `registerOrUpdateElement` method from `atom-utils-plus`.
 *
 * The decorator will take care to return the generated element class so that
 * you can just export it directly as demonstrated below.
 *
 * As supported by the `registerOrUpdateElement` method, static member will
 * be available on the new class.
 *
 * **Note: As there's some limitations when modifying the prototype
 * of a custom element, if you need to inject element callbacks (like
 * `createdCallback`) through a mixin, the mixins should be included before
 * converting the class as a custom element. You'll be able to achieve that by
 * placing the `include` decorator after the `element` one as shown in the
 * second example.**
 *
 * @param  {string} elementName the node name of the element to register
 * @return {Function} the element class as returned by
 *                    `document.registerElement`
 * @example
 * @element('dummy-element-name')
 * export default class SomeClass {
 *   // ...
 * }
 *
 * @element('dummy-element-with-mixin')
 * @include(SomeMixin)
 * export default class SomeClass {
 *   // ...
 * }
