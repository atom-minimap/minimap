  # Public: Adds a decoration that tracks a `Marker`. When the marker moves,

  # the marker's state.
  #
  # There are three types of supported decorations:
  #
  # * __line__: Fills the line background with the decoration color.
  # * __highlight__: Renders a colored rectangle on the minimap. The highlight
  #   is rendered above the line's text.
  # * __highlight-over__: Same as __highlight__.
  # * __highlight-under__: Renders a colored rectangle on the minimap. The
  #   highlight is rendered below the line's text.
  # * __highlight-outline__: Renders a colored outline on the minimap. The
  #   highlight box is rendered above the line's text.
  #
  # marker - A `Marker` you want this decoration to follow.
  # decorationParams - An {Object} representing the decoration eg.
  #                   `{type: 'gutter', class: 'linter-error'}`.
  #                   The object can have the following properties:
  #                   :type - The type {String}. There are a few supported
  #                           decoration types: `line`, `highlight`,
  #                           `highlight-over` and `highlight-under`
  #                   :class - This CSS class {String} will be used to retrieve
  #                            the background color of the decoration by
  #                            building a scope corresponding to `.minimap
  #                            .editor <your-class>`.
  #                   :scope - The scope {String} to use to retrieve the
  #                            decoration background. Note that if the `scope`
  #                            property is set, the `class` won't be used.
  #                   :color - The color {String} to use to render the
  #                            decoration. When set, neither `scope` nor `class`
  #                            are used.
