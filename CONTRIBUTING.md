### Contributing

When suggesting edits to the Minimap package try to follow the [Atom contribution guidelines](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Especially important is that the commits follow the conventions defined in the *Git Commit Messages* section of the guideline.

The `CHANGELOG` content is then generated using the [changelog-gen utils](https://github.com/abe33/changelog-gen).
